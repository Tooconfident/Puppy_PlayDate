	- Look for groups in my area, or in my dog's area, or anywhere on the map
		- Click on the group pin to access group info
			- Choose to join the groups / contact the group creator
		- I can define how far away I want to look
	- Chat with my groups
		- Communicate with my group about status, special events, to build community, provide real-time flexibility for group


	- Create a group with a ... (location, set time)
	- Can make my group private or public
	- Select types of dogs your group is looking for (put tags on groups)
	- Accept new dogs into your group
	- Edit your group details
