- Darker backgrounds show up better on video, but you can use whatever
- Each team member must present at least one portion of the presentation
- Create an architecture diagram if you are doing anything other than a traditional full-stack Rails app
- Script the demo
- Make sure all the data that will be a part of your demo is real, clean data
- Feel free to show code snippets you are particularly proud of or found especially daunting
- Code should be clear and concise enough to walk through with an audience
